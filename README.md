Design process
The entire design was in some part inspired by the website i made for FP1 in semester 1. However after some time, I realized in order to replicate the same or a similar style is different, so I took the liberty to change some parts to make it easier and more plausible for me to create. Overall there are 4 buttons at 4 corners that serves as nav bar for the readers to direct themselves, and all the pages are interconeected. All the content are centralized and split up into different section, all the web pages used a similar design language.
