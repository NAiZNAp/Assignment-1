            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
            Hi I am a 19 year old Common ICT student currently studying at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. I am a very curious person who is eager to learn and explore. I love learning things via a hands on approach as it really helps me to learn the most effectively. I came from a very competitive school where everyone strives for their best, this has influenced me to be more hardworking and put in my utmost when necessary. I am a team player and willing to sacrifice for the team when needed.
            ICT is a ever growing field and I hope my time in NP will enrich and prepare me for further studies and pursuing a career in ICT. I am very passionate about both design and business and wish to further my studies in either of these fields. In my 3 years in NP, I wish to further enrich myself and strive to achieve my best.
